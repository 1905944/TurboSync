# TurboSync - Lip Syncing App 

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

To use the app you first have to ensure two things:
1. The app is currently only compatable with google chrome so you will need to use that as your browser. 
2. You must have your mic connected on page load for the app to work correctly.

To begin recording just press the record button and allow the app to use your mic. When done, stop the recording and the lips will animate.
